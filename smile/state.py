    called by the **Experiment** which then uses our own scheduler to
    set the start and end times of our **State**. Below is a list of
    parameters and logged attributes that all **State** subclasses
    have access to and use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent : ParentState
        The parent state that this state is contained within
    duration : float
        The duration you would like the state to last in seconds
    save_log : Boolean (False)
        If set to True, will save a .slog with all of the information
        from this state.
    name : string
        The unique name you give this state.
    blocking : boolean (True)
        If True, this state will prevent a **Parallel** state from ending. If
        False, this state will be canceled if its **ParallelParent** finishes
        running. Only relevant if within a **ParallelParent**.

    Logged Attributes
    -----------------
    All parameters above and below are available to be accessed and
    manipulated within the experiment code, and will be automatically
    recorded in the state-specific log.

    instantiation_filename : string
        The file in which this state is instantiated.
    instantiation_lineno : int
        the line number that this particular state was instantiated.
    start_time : float
        The time the state was started in experimental runtime.
    end_time : float
        The time this state ended in experimental runtime.
    enter_time : float
        The time this state entered and started all of it's preprossessing in
        experimental runtime.
    leave_time : float
        Logged time that this state left, called callbacks, and ended processes
        in experimental runtime.
    finalize_time : float
        The time this state calls `finalize()`

    A **ParentState** that runs all of its children in parallel. This state's
    duration is equal to the longest duration of its children. That means this
    state will not end until all of its children are finished running. The only
    exception to this rule is *blocking* parameter.  If one of the children
    of this state set the *blocking* parameter to False, than it will not
    prevent this state from leaving. That means this states duration is equal
    to the longest duration out of its *blocking* children. Once this state
    *leaves* it will tell all of its non-blocking children to leave as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    children : list (None)
        A list containing any *States* that you wish to be the children of
        *ParentState*.
    parent : ParentState (None)
        The state that is the parent of this state. Defaults to whatever
        *ParentState* this state exists within.
    save_log : boolean (True)
        If set to True, will save a .slog with all of the information
        from this state.
    name : string
        The unique name you give this state.
    blocking : boolean (True)
        If True, this state will prevent a *Parallel* state from ending. If
        False, this state will be canceled if its *ParallelParent* finishes
        running. Only relevant if within a *ParallelParent*.

    Logged Attributes

    All parameters above and below are available to be accessed and
    manipulated within the experiment code, and will be automatically
    recorded in the state-specific log. Refer to State class

    Logged Attributes
    -----------------
    All parameters above are available to be accessed and manipulated within
    the experiment code, and will be automatically recorded in the
    state-specific log. Refer to State class docstring for additional logged
    parameters.

    Example
    -------

    The default state that an experiment is in is a Serial state.  That means
    that the following two examples are equal and will run exactly the same.

    ::

        exp = Experiment()

        Label(text='Hello,', duration=1)
        Label(text='Hello, W', duration=1)
        Label(text='Hello, World', duration=1)

        exp.run()

    ::

        exp = Experiment()

        with Serial():
            Label(text='Hello,', duration=1)
            Label(text='Hello, W', duration=1)
            Label(text='Hello, World', duration=1)

        exp.run()

    These examples will display 3 labels in serial and then the experiment will
    end.

    Another example that would be helpful is to use Serial within a **Parallel**
    state.  Say you want 2 sequences of states to run at the same time. The
    easiest way to accomplish this is to use 2 Serial states within a Parallel
    state.

    ::

        exp = Experiment()

        with Parallel():
            with Serial():
                Label(text='Im on the Left!', duration=2,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x-400)
                Wait(2)
                Label(text='Now Im on the Left again!!!', duration=2,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x-400)

            with Serial():
                Wait(2)
                Label(text='Now Im on the Right!', duration=2,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x+400)
                Wait(2)
                Label(text='Now Im on the Right again!!!', duration=2,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x400)

        exp.run()

    This example will take turns displaying Labels on either side of the
    screen. In reality it each Serial state will run at the same time, but to
    the eye it will look like they are taking turns.

class Subroutine(object):
    """A Subroutine is a decorator for making reusable bits of state-machine.

class If(SequentialState):
    """The way you do branching paths in a state machine.

    Parent state to implement conditional branching. **If** state is
    used in lieu of a traditional Python if statement. The SMILE
    **If** state will create a position linked list of *conditionals*
    and *states*.  It will then loop through the conditions, and when
    it finds a conditional that evaluates to True, it runs the
    corresponding state. The last *conditional* in the list is always
    a True boolean, which then corresponds to an **Else** state that
    you can define in your experiment.

    Under the hood, the If state will create 2 Serial states when it
    initializes. During experimental run time, it decides which state
    to actually run. If the next state is an Elif state then it will
    add itself to the possible states to run of the If state. If the
    next state is an Else state, then it will overwrite the Serial
    Else state that the If state creates at initialization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conditional : logical
        You may only use logical operators in this conditional statement,
        that means you may not use **and** or **or**. You must use *&* and
        *|* in order to do **and** and **or** respectively.
    true_state : ParentState (optional)
        If given a ParentState, and the conditional is evaluated to be
        True, then the given state will run. If a true_state is not
        defined, it will be created as a *Serial* state with this state's
        children.
    false_state : ParentState (optional)
        If given a ParentState, and the conditional is evaluated to be
        False, then the given state will run. If a false_state is not
        defined, it will be created as a *Serial* state that will do
        Nothing.
    parent : ParentState (optional)
        The parent to this state.
    save_log : boolean (optional, defaults = True)
        If True, this state will save all of its information into a .slog
        file.
    name : string (optional)
        The unique name of this state.
    blocking : boolean (optional, default = True)
        If True, this state will prevent a *Parallel* state from ending. If
        False, this state will be canceled if its *ParallelParent* finishes
        running. Only relevant if within a *ParallelParent*.

    Logged Attributes
    -----------------
    All parameters above and below are available to be accessed and
    manipulated within the experiment code, and will be automatically
    recorded in the state-specific log. Refer to State class
    docstring for additional logged parameters.

    outcome_index : integer
        The index pointing to which condition evaluated to True. Where 0 is the
        *If* conditional and n, the max number it could be, means none of the
        conditionals evaluated to true and it is running the *Else* state.

    Example
    -------

    ::

        with If(trial.current['condition1'] == 0 &
                trial.current['condition2'] == 2):
            Label(text=trial.current['stim'],
                  color=trial.current['color1'], duration=3)
        with Elif(trial.current['condition1'] == 1 &
                  trial.current['condition2'] == 0):
            Label(text=trial.current['stim'],
                  color=trial.current['color2'], duration=3)
        with Elif(trial.current['condition1'] == 1 &
                  trial.current['condition2'] == 0):
            Label(text=trial.current['stim'],
                  color=trial.current['color3'], duration=3)
        with Else():
            Label(text='No conditionals were true!', color='RED', duration=3)

    When we call `with Elif():` we are adding to the *If* state's internal list
    of **conditionals** and **states**. When you call `with Else():` you are
    adding to the children of the default **false_state**, which only runs if
    all the other conditionals evaluate to *False*.

    A *Loop* can be setup to run like the python **for**, **while**, or
    **do while** depending on what parameters you send into it.


    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iterable (default = None, optional)
        This is any iterable class. i.e. List, Seq, String, Tuple.  If this
        variable is set, then it will be looped over. *iterable* can also
        be an integer. If so, the *Loop* will loop a set number of times.
    shuffle : Boolean (default = False, optional)
        If shuffle is set to True, then your passed in iterable will be
        shuffled before it is presented.
    conditional : Boolean (default = True, optional)
        At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, it checks that
        conditional evaluates to true. In conjunction with an iterable, it
        will end early if the conditional every evaluates to False. Without
        an iterable, the loop will function as a while loop.
    parent : ParentState (optional)
        The parent to this state.
    save_log : boolean (optional, defaults = True)
        If True, this state will save all of its information into a .slog
        file.
    name : string (optional)
        The unique name of this state.
    blocking : boolean (optional, default = True)
        If True, this state will prevent a *Parallel* state from ending. If
        False, this state will be canceled if its *ParallelParent* finishes
        running. Only relevant if within a *ParallelParent*.

    -----------------
    All parameters above and below are available to be accessed and manipulated
    within the experiment code, and will be automatically recorded in the
    state-specific log. Refer to State class docstring for additional logged
    parameters.

    i : integer
        The index of the currect iterable.  If **iterable** was given an
        integer, then *i* will
        be the loop number in experimental run time.
    current : Ref
        A reference to the current iteration of the looping variable in
        experimental run time.
    outcome : boolean
        A reference to the current iteration of the loop, telling the user what
        the conditional evaluated out to be, True or False.

    Example
    -------
    the command most used with *Loop* is `with Loop(trials) as trial:`. This
    will loop over the list **trials**.  You are able to access the current
    iteration of the loop by accessing the attribute `trial.current`. The
    following is an example that loops over a list of dictionaries and presents
    the name of a person and their favorite food.

    ::

        words = [{'name':'bob',    'food':'pringle'},
                 {'name':'tom',    'food':'prune'},
                 {'name':'paul',   'food':'potato'},
                 {'name':'chelsea','food':'dooughnut'},
                 {'name':'dinese', 'food':'corn'},
                 {'name':'emily',  'food':'pizza'}]

        with Loop(words) as trial:

            with Parallel():
                Label(text=trial.current['name'], duration=3,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x/2)
                Label(text=trial.current['food'], duration=3,
                      center_x=exp.screen.center_x*3/2)

    The following is an example on how to loop X number of times. To access
    what the current iteration number is, you must call `trial.i`.

    ::

        X = 15
        with Loop(X) as trial:
            Label(text=trial.i, duration=1)

    The following is an example of a **while** kind of *Loop*. All you have to
    do is set the conditional.

    ::

        exp.X = 15
        with Loop(conditional = exp.X < 20):
            Label(text=exp.X, duration=3)

class Log(AutoFinalizeState):
    """Used to log any variables during experimental run time.

    A *Log* state is used to log any number of variables that you want to
    record to a .slog file.  Where ever it appears in your experiment, it will
    save out the values of all of the arguments you give it at that point in
    your experiment.  Each call to *Log* will save to a separate file. If used
    within a *Loop* state, it will write a row to the .slog for each iteration
    of the loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_dict : dictionary (optional)
        Use case for this parameter is to pass in `trial.current`, as long
        as `trial.current` is a dictionary. This will save out all of the
        values of the the current iteration of your looping variable into
        different columns, like `log_dict_stim, log_dict_duration`.
    parent : ParentState (optional)
        The state you would like this state to be a child of. If not set,
        the *Experiment* will make it a child of a ParentState or the
        Experiment automatically.
    name : string (optional)
        The unique name of this state
    kwargs : (keyword = argument)
        As many arguments as you would like to pass in. Use the format
        `keyword = variable_name` and *Log* will log the value of
        **variable_name** into a column called **keyword**.

    Example
    -------
    This is an example of using *Log* in a *Loop*. Refer to the individual
    state's Doc Strings if something doesn't make sense, because this example
    brings a lot of different ideas together.

        state ends when the until is evaluated as true, and *error* gives you
        the maximum value that the error could be when setting the *time*.
    until_value : Ref
        A reference to the *until*.  This will be evaluated at a later time.

    """The way you call and run a function during experimental run time

    A *Func* is a state that calls a function during experimental run time. The
    first argument is always the name of the function and the rest of the
    arguments are the arguments that are sent to the function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        Whatever function you would like to run as experimental run time.
    pargs : positional arguments (argument, argument, argument)
        This just means you can send in parameters to *func* without
        setting the keyword.
    kwargs : (keyword = argument, keyword2 =argument2, ...)
        Whatever keyword arguments you need to send to *func*.
    parent : ParentState
        The parent state that this state is contained within.
    duration : float
        The duration you would like the state to last in seconds.
    save_log : Boolean (False)
        If set to True, will save a .slog with all of the information from
        this state.
    name : string, optional, default = None
        The unique name you give this state.
    blocking : boolean. defualt = True, optional
        If True, this state will prevent a *Parallel* state from ending. If
        False, this state will be canceled if its *ParallelParent* finishes
        running. Only relevant if within a *ParallelParent*.

    Logged Attributes
    -----------------
    All parameters above and below are available to be accessed and manipulated
    within the experiment code, and will be automatically recorded in the
    state-specific log. Refer to State class docstring for additional logged
    parameters.

    result : Ref
        A reference to the return value of this function, to be evaluated at
        experimental run time.

    Example
    -------

    ::

        def add_num(input, additive):
            input += additive
            return input

        Y = 15
        X = Func(add_num, input=Y, additive=5)
        Label(text=Ref(str, X.result), duration=2)

    This example will add 5 to `exp.X`. Very simple, but without using the
    *Func* state, you would be running **add_num** outside of experiment
    runtime.

    arguments. Below is an example for how to properly use the **Debug** state
    and the sample output that it produces.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent : ParentState
        The parent state that this state is contained within
    save_log : Boolean (False)
        If set to True, will save a .slog with all of the information
