Data accessing and Processing

Saving your Data into SLOG Files
================================

In SMILE, each state will produce what is called a *.slog* file by default.
This file is a specially compressed file filled with all of the important data
associated with the state.  It logs not only all of the parameters, but also
all of the variables listed in the *Logged Attributes* section of the
docstrings. In most cases, every state will save out 2 rows of data to the
*.slog* file.  The first row is the field names and the second row will the the
data for each of those fields.

The kind of state that writes multiple lines out to its associated *.slog* file
is the :py:class:`~smile.state.Log` state.  Wherever you put it into your experiment, it will log the
values of all of the keywords/argument pairs you pass into it.  It your *Log*
exists within a loop, it will write out the values of the keyword/argument
pairs during each iteration of the loop during experimental runtime.  In this
case, the *.slog* file will have the first row be the keywords, and the
subsequent rows be all of the data for each *Log* during each iteration of the
loop.

.. note::

    Every instance of the Log state in your experiment will save to a seperate
    file.

Below is an example of a *Log* state.

.. code-block:: python

    with Loop(10) as trial:
        lb = Label(text=trial.i, duration=2)
        Log(trial.current,
            name="looping_log",
            label_appear_time=lb.appear_time['time'])

This example will save 11 rows into a `.slog` file. If ``trial.current`` is the
first argument for *Log*, then it will save out all of the information about
your looping variable out in different columns.

A Record state will record all of the references given.  It will write a line
to the `.slog` file everytime one of the references changes. It will also log
the time at which the given reference changed.

Reading your SLOG files in python
=================================

In order to slog through your data, you are going to need to do one of two
things. The first would be to pull your data into python by using the :py:class:`~smile.state.Log`
method called :py:func:`~smile.state.log2dl`. This method converts your `.slog` file to a
list of dicitonairies so that you can perform any pythonic functions on it in
order to analyze your data. *log2dl* has one required parameter,
*log_filename*, which should be a string that starts out `log_` and ends with
whatever you put in the *name* parameter of yours *Log* in your experiment.

If there are multiple files with the same name, they have trailing `_#` in the
filename. *log2dl* will pull all of the files with the same base name, and
concatinate them into one long list of dictionaries.

The other way you can access your data is to convert all of your `.slog` files
to `.csv` files. You can do this very easily by running the :py:func:`~smile.state.log.Log2csv`
method. This method will take two parameters, *log_filename* and *csv_filename*.
*log_filename* works the same way as in *log2dl*, where you need to pass in
a string that is `log_` plus the name that you provided in the *name* parameter
of your *Log*. If no *csv_filename* is given, then it will be saved as the
same name as your *log_filename* plus `.csv`. From there, you can use your
prefered method of analyzing your data.
