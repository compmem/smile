Below are a few links to full recognizable experiments that were coded up in
SMILE. They include the idea behind the experiment, an explination of the code,
and they include a mini-analysis of the data collected. These real world kinds
of examples will give you a better understanding into exactly how to code a
SMILE experiment in real world conditions, rather than in bite sized samples of
code.
