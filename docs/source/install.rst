============================
Installation of Smile!
============================

Getting ready to SMILE? Then you are in the correct place. This guide will tell
you how to install SMILE and the package that SMILE is dependant on, Kivy! To
start out, we will install Kivy.

Installing SMILE on Windows
---------------------------

The first thing you need to download and install for this installation is
*Kivy*. Follow the link provided and download the Windows specific version of
Kivy.

    -`Windows Portable Install <http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html>`_

Run the **.exe** you just downloaded and then tell the program to extract Kivy
into a location that you know will be easy to find later, like your *Documents*
folder or your *Program Files* folder.

This extracts a portable version of Kivy to your computer. We will need this to
run SMILE. The next thing we are going to do is add Kivy to your build path.
This allows you to call `kivy-2.7` from any directory in the command prompt.

::

    > setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Path\To\Kivy"

Run this line but replace `C:\Path\To\Kivy` with the path to the folder
containing the file **kivy-2.7**. The quotes are needed.

.. warning::

    Be very careful not to mess up this command.

After running the last command, it is now time to download SMILE. Download
SMILE from the github link provided and then extract it.

    -`SMILE Download <https://github.com/compmem/smile/tree/kivy>`_

Now, in your command prompt, navigate to the newly extracted smile download
folder that contains setup.py and run the following line.

::

    > kivy -m pip install .

This installs SMILE to Kivy's portable version of python, that isn't connected
to your version of python at all.

The final thing you need to install to gain access to all of SMILE's
functionallity is PYO. Download and install the windows version of PYO from
their website. The link is provided below.

    -`PYO Download <http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/>`_

With that, you are finished installing SMILE. Congrats! Head over to

Windows Troubleshooting
+++++++++++++++++++++++

*If you accidentally installed smile to your person python distribution*
instead of kivy's python distribution, you will recieve an error similar to
`ImportError: No module named smile` when trying to import smile.

The solution is to first, delete smile from your personal python distribuiton.
Navigate to the smile download folder in your command promt and run the
following.

::

    > python -m pip uninstall .

Then, install smile to kivy's python distribution.

::

    > kivy-2.7 -m pip install .

*If you are trying to replace an older version of smile*, or if you just need
to upgrade your currect version, you must run the following command while the
command promt is in the smile download folder

::

    > kivy-2.7 -m pip install . --update


Installing SMILE on Mac
-----------------------

If you are installing on Mac, please download and install Continume Anaconda
first. It allows for you to have an easy to use package manager for python and
it comes with a code editor. The following link will take you to the Anaconda
Download page.

    -`Anaconda Download <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_

Anaconda uses your local version of Python, so any of the packages available to
your python will be available to anaconda and any packages installed with
anaconda will be available to your python.

The next step is to download and install kivy. The following link will take you
to the Mac-Kivy install guide.

    -`Mac-Kivy Install Guide <http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-macosx.html>`_

After you install Kivy, you must download and install SMILE. The following is a
link to the smile download page, where you will download the zip, and extract
it to an easy to find place.

    -`SMILE Download <https://github.com/compmem/smile/tree/kivy>`_

Now, all you have to do is open the Anaconda Command Prompt and navigate to the
newly extracted smile download folder. This folder should contain setup.py. Run
the following line to install SMILE to your python ditribution

::

    $ pip install .

Easy, smile should have installed without any issue.

The final thing you need to install to gain access to all of SMILE's
functionallity is PYO. Download and install the Mac version of PYO from their
website. The link is provided below.

Installing Smile with Linux
---------------------------

SMILE requires Kivy to run properly, but if you would like to use the
smild.sound functionallity, you need to download and install PYO aswell. Run
the following in your command line to install both Kivy and PYO at the same
time.

::

    $ sudo aptitude install python-pyo python-kivy

Then, download SMILE from github and extract it to a place you can find later.
The download link is the following.

    -`SMILE Download <https://github.com/compmem/smile/tree/kivy>`_

Next, navigate to the newly extracted smile folder, that contains setup.py, and
run the following line in your command prompt.

::

    $ pip install .

This will add SMILE to your python distribuiton.

With that, you are finished installing SMILE. Congrats! Head over to
