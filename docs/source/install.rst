Installation of Smile!
============================

Getting ready to SMILE? Then you are in the correct place. This guide will tell you how to install SMILE and the package that SMILE is dependant on, Kivy! To start out, we will install Kivy

Kivy Install
----------------------------

The first thing to look at is what O.S. you are running.  On all 3 major systems you are able to install kivy with no problem into your default python build. If you are running Windows, however, there is a portable version of Kivy that includes all of the dependencies so you don't have to go hunting around for the correct version that works on your machine. Below are a list of links to the appropriate Kivy install tutorial for your O.S. Veiw the General Installation guide
