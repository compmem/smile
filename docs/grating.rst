The following example, grating.py will be examined. A program was written to
produce a Gabor filter in a window.

Here is the definition of our *Grating*:

.. code-block:: python


    @WidgetState.wrap
    class Grating(Widget):
        """Creates a Gabor filter by generating a grating that is masked by either
        a Gaussian, linear, or circular mask. Due to the limitations of Kivy, this
        widget and only create square textures.

        Parameters
        ----------
        color_one : list
            first rgb color(each value between zero to one) which the grating will
            oscillate between
        color_two : list
            first rgb color(each value between zero to one) which the grating will
            oscillate between
        envelope : string
            type of Grating to be generated
            - Gaussian: creates a circular, Gaussian algorithm-based mask which becomes
                        more transparent the more distant from the center
            - Linear: creates a circular, linear algorithm-based mask which becomes
                      more transparent the more distant from the center
            - Circular: creates a circular mask which has no blending to the background
        frequency : float
            frequency of sine wave of Grating
        phase : float
            the phase shift of the sin wave
        std_dev : integer
            the standard deviation of the Gaussian mask controlling the size of the
            mask. Larger values create a larger grating on screen due to greater
            transparency and smaller values create smaller grating on screen due to
            less transparency.
        """

        envelope = StringProperty('g')
        frequency = NumericProperty(20)
        std_dev = NumericProperty(None)
        phase = NumericProperty(0.0)
        color_one = ListProperty([1., 1., 1.])
        color_two = ListProperty([0., 0., 0.])

In *Grating*, several different parameters can be passed into the
`__init__` method in order to create different kinds of Gabor filters.

- envelope : A string that instructs the program to create a Gaussian, linear, or
             circular filter

- frequency : An integer value that controls the frequency of the grating's wave

- std_dev : An integer value that controls the size of the standard deviation of
            the Gaussian mask. (The larger the value, the more transparent the
            mask will be)

- phase : a float value that controls the phase shift of the grating's wave

- color_one : a list of values each ranging from zero to one which represents RGB
              coloring and designates one of the colors the grating oscillates between.

- color_two : a list of values each ranging from zero to one which represents RGB
              coloring and designates the other color the grating oscillates between.

Next, the '__init__' method is declared for the 'Grating' widget:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(type(self), self).__init__(**kwargs)

        if self.std_dev is None:
            self.std_dev = (self.width/2) * 0.1

        self._texture = None
        self._mask_texture = None

        self.bind(envelope=self._update_texture,
                  std_dev=self._update_texture,
                  phase=self._update_texture,
                  color_one=self._update_texture,
                  color_two=self._update_texture,
                  frequency=self._update_texture,
                  pos=self._update,
                  size=self._update_texture)
        self._update_texture()

The `.bind()` method will bind each different attribute of the Gabor filter to a
method callback that might want to run if any of those attributes change.
An example of this is if, in SMILE, an :py:class:`~smile.video.UpdateWidget'
state is created where it updates a **Grating** attribute, e.g. `std_dev` attribute.
The attribute change will cause Kivy to callback the corresponding function
attached with `.bind()`. Also, take note of the cache functionality of the Grating
stimuli, to increase speed and efficiency of the code. Now the functions can be defined:

.. code-block:: python

    def _calc_mask(self, rx, ry):
        dx = rx - (self.width/2.)   # horizontal center of Grating
        dy = ry - (self.height/2.)  # vertical center of Grating
        radius = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)
        #Gaussian Gabor stimuli calculations
        if self.envelope[0].lower() == 'g':
            transparency = math.exp(-0.5 * (dy / (self.std_dev*3)) ** 2 - 0.5 *
                                    (dx / (self.std_dev*3)) ** 2)

        elif self.envelope[0].lower() == 'c':
            if (radius > 0.5 * self.width):
                transparency = 0.0
            else:
                transparency = 1.0
        else:

The *Grating* widget works step-wise to create a Gabor filter. First, it creates
a grating based on the '_calc_color' function. The function creates an oscillating
grating between two chosen colors(using color_one and color_two variables), or the default
black and white color. The frequency of oscillation and the phase of oscillation can be
controlled by the phase and frequency variables, as well.

The next step of the program is to create the overlaying mask. The purpose of the
mask is to layer over the grating texture so a fading/blending to the background
can occur. Two envelope values can be passed to have a gradient fade/blend to
background. These variables are setting the envelope to 'gaussian' or 'linear'.
The other variable, 'circular', when set to envelope, makes a circular mask overlay
with no fading/blending to the background. The characteristics of the mask can be
changed with the std_dev variable. This numeric value, when increased, causes the
Gaussian mask becomes larger, causing more of the masked grating
to be revealed due to the increase in transparency. Conversely, when the std_dev
variable is set to smaller numeric values, the Gaussian mask
becomes smaller, causing more of the masked grating to be revealed due to the
decrease in transparency. The default value for the std_dev variable is half of
the width of the passed width value multiplied by 0.1. This value was chosen
as default because the mask is created in the bottom left fourth quadrant then mirrored
repeated three times to the top left, top right, and bottom right, creating an entire
mask. Being so, the width value is divided by 2 to give the radius. The 0.1 multiplied
value was used because it yields an complete opacity at borders of the Gabor filter
and the background, creating an ideal blending to the background.

The *Grating* widget also uses special openGL functionality. The last two functions
of the class control how the alpha values of the mask interact with the program.
.. code-block:: python

    '''Controller for the Gabor blending to the background color
    glBlendFunc(starting RGBA values, desired RGBA values)'''
    def _set_blend_func(self, instruction):
        glBlendFunc(GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, GL_SRC_ALPHA)

    '''Reset of the Gabor blending properties for creation of new stimuli
    glBlendFunc(starting RGBA values, desired RGBA values)'''
    def _reset_blend_func(self, instruction):
        glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)

These two functions make the increasing alpha values of the grating's mask to
blend in with the background, rather than turning black. The second function resets,
or turns off this functionality once finished with the mask.

Examples of Gabor Filters
=========================

Grating()
When passing no parameters into the Grating widget, the return is a grated box,
oscillating between black and white:

.. image:: _static/no_variables.png
    :width: 350
    :height: 318
    :align: center

Grating(width=500, height=500, envelope='gaussian')
When passing width, height, and envelope parameters, notice the sizing of the Gabor
filter changes and how the style of the mask changes:

.. image:: _static/default_gaussian.png
    :width: 652
    :height: 566
    :align: center

Grating(width=500, height=500, envelope='linear')
This is the same parameters as the above example except the envelop is now 'linear',
notice how the mask changes:

.. image:: _static/default_linear.png
    :width: 602
    :height: 596
    :align: center

Grating(width=500, height=500, envelope='Circular')
This is the same parameters as the above example except the envelop is now 'Circular',
notice how the mask changes:

.. image:: _static/default_circular.png
    :width: 674
    :height: 626
    :align: center

Grating(width=500, height=500, envelope='gaussian', phase=1.5, frequency=10)
This is the same parameters as the above example except the envelop is now 'gaussian'.
Also, the phase and frequency have changed, which changes the look of the grating
behind the mask:

.. image:: _static/adjusted_phase_and_frequency.png
    :width: 470
    :height: 460
    :align: center

Grating(width=500, height=500, envelope='gaussian', phase=1.5, frequency=10,
        std_dev=10, color_one='green', color_two='red')
This is the same parameters as the above example except the colors have changed.
The colors can either be set by changing 3 list values between zero and one or
by using plain English color names as strings. Also, the std_dev has been set to a smaller
value, making the grating smaller due to the mask being smaller:

.. image:: _static/red_green_smaller_std_dev.png
    :width: 460
    :height: 378
    :align: center
