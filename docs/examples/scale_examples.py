# This is an example on how to use the scale function in smile. You can use the
# scale function to make sure that your stimuli are the same size regardless of
# screen density. You can also use scale to scale up or down your stimuli to
# fill or fit into whatever size monitor you would like, as long as you set a
# scale_box. scale_box is set in pixel space. If you keep all of your simuli
# within the scale_box and you set scale_up/down to True, all of your simuli
# will appear on any screen you run the experiment on.

# Sometimes you might want to scale down only if the screen is too small to fit
# your stimuli. In this case you set a *scale_box* and the scale_up/down flags.
# If scale_down is True, **scale** will scale your numbers such that the dp on
# your scale box is able to fit within the screen. If the screen is bigger than
# the scale box, then your sizing numbers will only be scaled by **dp**, meaning
# your stimuli will look the same on all monitors that are bigger than the
# scale box.

# NOTE If you want to test out what your code would look like on a different
# monitor (that is smaller than the one you already have up), you can run the
# following line in the command line:
#                python your_code.py -r **width**x**height**
# Where width and height are replaced with the resolution of the monitor you
# want to test.

RADIUS = 100


# Set a scale_box to [600, 500] which is [width, height] and scale_up/scale_down
# to make sure that no matter what the monitor size is, everything will be scale
# to fit in side a scale_box.
exp = Experiment(scale_box=[600,500], scale_up=True, scale_down=True)

# As an example, if you run this file on one computer, and then another one
# with a different monitor size, the first number in this debug should be
# different on both machines, but the second number will be 10.
