How to stroop!
==============

You are going to be presented a few lists of words that are colors. When a word
appears on the screen, you are to say the text color's name as clearly as
possible. You want to minimize the time it takes you to respond, but not the
time it takes you to say the whole word.

EXAMPLE
-------

If the word is "Green" but the text color is "Orange" you would say "Orange" as
soon as you can.

If the word is "Green" and the text color is "Green" you would say "Green" as
soon as you can.

REMINDER : Say the Color of the text out loud, not the printed word on the screen!

Press any key to continue! Good Luck!
